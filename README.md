## ✨ Technologies

This project was developed using the following technologies:

- [Robot Framework 6.1.1](https://robotframework.org/)
- [Python 3.7.4](https://www.python.org/)


## 💻 Project

This project is designed to perform GET method tests on the endpoint `https://catfact.ninja/breeds`. The following test cases have been automated:

- **CT01**: Valid request to GET `/breeds` returns status code 200 and a list of breeds.
- **CT02**: Request with invalid limit parameter returns status code 400 and an error message.
- **CT03**: Validate that specifying the limit parameter `1` returns only the first object in the list.

### 📚 Libs

- RequestsLibrary:
    - What it does: Imports the RequestsLibrary, enabling HTTP requests (such as GET, POST, etc.) and handling responses within Robot Framework tests.
    - Why it's important: Without this library, it wasn't be able to make HTTP requests to test APIs.

- Collections:
    - What it does: Imports the Collections library, providing useful functions for manipulating lists and dictionaries within Robot Framework.
    - Why it's important: It helps manipulate and verify structured data like lists and dictionaries, which are commonly used when testing APIs.


## 🚀 How to run

1. Clone the this repository.

2. Install [Python 3.7.4](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-374/).

3. Install Robot Framework by running the following command in your terminal:

    `pip install robotframework==6.1.1`

4. Install the lib RequestsLibrary: 
This library is used in the tests. You can install it via pip by running the following command in your terminal:

    `pip install robotframework-requests`

    *Tip*: Collections Library: This is a standard library in Robot Framework, so no additional installation is required.

5. Navigate to the project directory and then to the /tests folder. Run the tests using the following command in your terminal:

    `robot --outputdir test_results get_breeds.robot`

    *Tip*: The `--outputdir test_results` option will place the generated files by Robot Framework into the tests/test_results directory.


## 📄 Test results

After running the tests, you will find the following files in the test_results directory:

- log.html: Detailed log of the test execution.
- report.html: Summary report of the test results.
- output.xml: Machine-readable test results.


Feel free to review these files to analyze the test outcomes.
